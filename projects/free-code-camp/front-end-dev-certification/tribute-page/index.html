            <blockquote>"There will never be a more pure or powerful drumming force, or a higher level of drumming intelligence and passion, than that of Mr. Elvin Jones. Elvin represented everything that was good and great about jazz and life: the swinginâ€™est beat, the brightest smile, the warmest (and most sweat-stoked!) embrace. Elvin was the life force of our music. And as hard as it is to imagine life and jazz without his bodily presence, he lives on in the tremendous body of recorded work he left us, and in the memories of those who were lucky enough to know him or see him in person. Elvin Jones left the world a much better place."
            <h5><em>- Peter Erskine</em></h5></blockquote>
